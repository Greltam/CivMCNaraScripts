If using MultiMC, start a new instance,
  1. Under Version on the left side menu, set Minecraft version to 1.21.1
  2. Install NeoForge version 21.1.90 from the right side menu
  3. Go to Loader mods from the left side menu
  4. Click Add from the right side menu
  5. Travel to Downloads folder or where you saved JSMacros, click the JSMacros .jar, and then click open at the bottom.

Disclaimer: New scripts added require 2 runs of the NaraGHScriptDownloader.js to first update the updater, then download the new script.
If altering scripts, make sure to rename or move into a different folder so the auto-downloader/updater script doesn't destroy your altered script
